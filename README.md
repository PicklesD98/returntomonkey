#i spent way to much time on this but i added a hit and a miss counter as well as making the game work to start. i added continious background music, i made a way for you to win #and lose the game, to lose you miss 10 times to win you hit 100 times. i also made the background flash a picture of a monkey i found on googel that i thought was funny when ever the bass of the music kicks that one i am proud of. other than that i did evertyting else that was required
